### Create a New Branch

It's a good practice to work on a separate branch for each new feature or bug fix. Create a new branch using a descriptive name:

```sh
git checkout -b github-final-project/your-feature-name
```

Now you're ready to make changes!

## Making Changes

### Coding Standards

Please follow the coding standards and best practices of the project. If there are no specific guidelines, use consistent naming conventions, and write clean and well-documented code.

### Testing

Ensure that your changes don't break existing functionality. If applicable, write tests for your code. Your contributions should be thoroughly tested and free from bugs.

## Submitting Changes

### Pull Request Guidelines

When you're ready to submit your changes, follow these steps:

1. Commit your changes with clear and concise messages.
2. Push your changes to your forked repository.
3. Create a pull request (PR) from your forked repository to the main project repository.
4. Provide a descriptive title and a clear description of the changes in the PR.

A project maintainer will review your PR, suggest improvements if necessary, and merge it once it meets the project's standards.
